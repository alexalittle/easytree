            <h2>About this project:</h2>
            <p><span id="logo">Easy Tree</span> is an interactive 
            program for creating, editing, and saving tree structures.</p>
            <p>This GUI was designed by Alexa Little for ALC Adelphi,
                as part of the 2015 <a href='http://www.usaeop.com/programs/apprenticeships/cql/'>CQL summer program.</a></p>
            <p>The interactive tree structure is based on 
                <a href="http://www.robschmuecker.com/d3-js-drag-and-drop-zoomable-tree">
                    this code</a> by Rob Schmuecker. I have added functions to 
                    track and download changes, so the tree can now be used to
                     edit and save data.</p>
            <p>Many thanks to Dr. Stephen Tratz, my CQL sponsor.</p>
